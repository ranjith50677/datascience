Now a  days highly common travelling with airlines companies and since it is common.
Customer satisfication is one of the most important deciding factor.


```{r}
plane <- read.csv(file.choose(),header=TRUE)
```

                                      Problem Definition
                                      
        Customer satisfaction survey we can predict the most essential feature that leads to satisfied customer they are seat comfort     
        checkin service etc....
        Then, we can predict the rating of the passenger we can predict which featured are important and which should be improved..

        This dataset is US Airline passenger satisfaction survey
        Dataset is obtained from kaggle 
        there are 24 features and 129880 observations
        There are two classes called "satisfied" and "Netural/ Dissatisfied"
        
        
        Key variables
